Overview
The EtchAttnCVAE repository provides the implementation of a deep learning model designed for predicting the evolution of plasma etching processes in semiconductor manufacturing. Built upon the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture, EtchAttnCVAE integrates advanced attention mechanisms to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in etching time series data. This model enables accurate predictions of depth-dependent etching profiles and facilitates hotspot detection, ultimately contributing to enhanced process optimization and quality control.
